== Change Calculator

A rails application responsible for calculating optimal change denomination for a given change value from 1 to 99 cents.

== Usage

This app was built using Rails version 2.3.5 and ruby 1.8.7
To start the application server in development mode locally, run script/server and goto http://localhost:3000/

You can then enter the change value in cents between 1 and 99 and the system will output the optimal change denomination

== config

  For example to use the coin set [50,25,10,5,1] the following is added
  coin_set:
    - 50
    - 25
    - 10
    - 5
    - 1

The tests are written using standard rails testing
